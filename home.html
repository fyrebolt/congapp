                <hr id="whyVoteLine">
                <ul id="whyList"> 
                    <li><strong>Civic Duty</strong>: Voting encourages individuals to actively participate in the democratic process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selection of Representatives</strong>: By voting, you can choose representatives who resonate with your values and beliefs, ensuring your voice is accurately represented in government.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Voting encourages community engagement by creating awareness of current events and active participation in public discourse, and promotes informed conversations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equality and Inclusivity</strong>: Voting promotes true equality and inclusivity between yourself and your peers, providing every eligible citizen, regardless of background, with an equal voice in American politics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advocating Change</strong>: You can advocate change and progress in society by voting, as it allows you to express your interests and work towards reforming national policies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="whyVoteSub">Does my vote even matter?</p>
                <p class="whyVoteDesc">Many people believe that with so many other Americans voting, their single vote won't matter. But many elections, especially local elections, often end in thin margins, making individual voters so important.</p>
                <p class="whyVoteDesc">If you give up your vote, you may end up with representatives that <strong>do not govern with your interests in mind!</strong></p>
                <p class="whyVoteSub">How does the voting process work?</p>
                <p class="whyVoteDesc">The American voting system is based on a representative democracy. Citizens register to vote, then participate in general elections to choose their leaders, including the President.</p>
                <p class="whyVoteDesc">Presidential elections are held every 4 years, and the Electoral College determines the winner. Each state is allocated as many electors as representatives it has in the House and Senate, and the process for choosing these electors varies by state. The popular vote determines the candidate that each stateâ€™s electors vote for. The candidate who secures at least 270 out of the total 538 electoral votes wins the election and becomes President.</p>
                <p class="whyVoteDesc">This process is a compromise between the federal and state governments, preventing states with large populations from determining the outcome.</p>
                <p class="whyVoteSub">Am I eligible to vote?</p>
                <p class="whyVoteDesc">Voting requirements in the United States typically include being a U.S. citizen, meeting a minimum age requirement of 18 years old, and registering to vote within your state. Some states may have additional, specialized requirements.</p>
